# Flippy
##Synopsis
The object of the game is to remember where all the non-zero values are. One by one, each tile will be revealed their value at the beginning of each round. When all tiles are shown, click the tiles with numbers greater than zero to acquire that many number of extra moves. If you run out of moves, you lose!

##Usage
A live demo of the game is available at http://donald-ngai.com/Games/Flippy/game.html

##Motivation
I build this game when I was first trying to learn more about web development and coding more complicated things using Javascript. As a result, I created this game as a fun way of learning.
